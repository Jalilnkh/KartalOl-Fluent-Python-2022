    "T-distributed stochastic neighbourhood embedding (t-SNE): t-SNE is also a unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction and data visualization technique. The math behind t-SNE is quite complex but the idea is simple. It embeds the points from a higher dimension to a lower dimension trying to preserve the neighborhood of that point."

    "Yes, the bias value is updated during training in a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The bias term is a parameter associated with each neuron that helps to shift the activation function, allowing the network to fit data more accurately and enhance its learning capability."
