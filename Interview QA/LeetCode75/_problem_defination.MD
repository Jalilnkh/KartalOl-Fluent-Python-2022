We will solve 75 LeetCode practice. The following table shows name of problems with description.

| Number |Problem title| Description|Example|
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| 1. |Two Sum| Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.| Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9, Output: [0,1],Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].|
|2.| Add Two Numbers| You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.| Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4], Output: [7,0,8], Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.|
