We will solve 75 LeetCode practice. The following table shows name of problems with description.

| Number |Problem title| Description|Example|
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| 1. |Two Sum| Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.| Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9, Output: [0,1],Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].|
|2.| Add Two Numbers| You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.| Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4], Output: [7,0,8], Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.|
|3.|Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters| Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring without repeating characters.| Input: s = "abcabcbb", Output: 3, Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.| 
|4. | Median of Two Sorted Arrays| Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).| Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2], Output: 2.00000, Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.|
|5. | Longest Palindromic Substring| Given a string s, return the longest palindromic(A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.) substring in s.| Input: s = "babad", Output: "bab", Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.|
|6. | Zigzag Conversion | The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility) | Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3, Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR" |
