The cal.py module contains code and business logic. There are no unit tests to validate its operation.

Write tests in the Python framework of your choice (py.test was proposed in the project - you can replace it with any library you prefer).

We strongly advise that you develop locally or use the PyCharm Web IDE. The project contains all the dependencies that may be needed for its testing. The use of attached libraries is neither required nor expected. The project can be built and run using make.

We take into account primarily:

readability of tests,
selected test cases / scenarios.
