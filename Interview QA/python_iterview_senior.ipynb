    "### Q1: What is a Python decorator, and how does it work?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A Python decorator is a design pattern that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function or class that they modify. Under the hood, a decorator is just a callable (usually a function) that takes another function as an argument and returns a function. This allows the decorator to execute code before and after the target function runs, without modifying the function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello()\n",

    "### Q2: How do you manage memory in Python? \n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses automatic memory management with a built-in garbage collector, which means that it keeps track of objects and automatically frees memory when objects are no longer in use. Python primarily uses reference counting to manage memory, which means it keeps a count of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object's reference count drops to zero, Python will automatically deallocate it. Additionally, Python's garbage collector detects and cleans up cyclic references (where two or more objects refer to each other, creating a cycle) that reference counting alone cannot handle.\n"

    "### Q3: Explain the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python.\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "In Python, `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` are used to define methods within a class that are not explicitly tied to an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@staticmethod` is used to define a method that does not operate on an instance of the class nor modify the class state. It does not take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter. It's basically like a regular function that belongs to the class's namespace.\n",
    "- `@classmethod`, on the other hand, takes `cls` as the first parameter while `self` is not used. `cls` refers to the class itself, not an instance of the class. This method can modify the class state that applies across all instances of the class, or call other class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_var = \"I am a class variable\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def my_static_method():\n",
    "        print(\"I do not modify the class or instances.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def my_class_method(cls):\n",
    "        print(cls.class_var)\n",
    "        print(\"I can modify the class itself.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "MyClass.my_static_method()\n",
    "MyClass.my_class_method()\n",
    "\n",

    "### Q4: What are the key differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The key differences between lists and tuples in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutability**: Lists are mutable, meaning that you can modify them after their creation (add, remove, or change items). Tuples, however, are immutable; once created, you cannot change them. This immutability makes tuples slightly faster than lists when it comes to iteration.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Because they are immutable, tuples are used for data that shouldn't change over time, which provides a sort of integrity. Lists are used when you need a sequence of items that you might need to modify. Tuples can also be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot.\n"

    "### Q5: How does Python handle type conversion?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Python provides several built-in functions to perform explicit type conversion, which is also known as type casting. The programmer can convert data types by using these functions. Some common functions include `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number_str = \"123\"\n",
    "number_int = int(number_str)  # Converts string to integer\n",
    "print(number_int + 1)  # 124\n",
    "\n",
    "number_float = float(number_str)  # Converts string to float\n",

    "### Q6: What is a generator in Python, and how does it differ from a normal function?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A generator in Python is a special type of iterator. It is defined like a normal function but uses the `yield` statement to return data. Each time `next()` is called on a generator, it resumes from where it left off (it remembers all the data values and which statement was last executed). An important feature of generators is that they do not store all the results in memory; instead, they generate the results on the fly, which makes them very memory efficient when working with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def countdown(num):\n",
    "    print(\"Starting\")\n",
    "    while num > 0:\n",
    "        yield num\n",
    "        num -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in countdown(5):\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "Starting\n",

    "### Q7: Describe the Python GIL. What is it and how does it affect multithreading?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This lock is necessary because Python's memory management is not thread-safe. The GIL can be a performance bottleneck for CPU-bound and multithreaded programs, as it allows only one thread to execute at a time even in a multi-core processor. It's less of an issue for I/O-bound applications where the lock is often released."

    "### Q8: What are Python metaclasses and what are they good for?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Metaclasses in Python are classes of classes; they define how a class behaves. A metaclass in Python is to a class what a class is to an instance. They are used to create or modify classes before they are created. Metaclasses can be used to implement features such as registering subclasses, adding methods dynamically, or enforcing certain properties on classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Meta(type):\n",
    "    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dict):\n",
    "        x = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dict)\n",
    "        x.attr = 100\n",

    "### Q9: How can you improve the performance of a Python application?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "There are several strategies to improve the performance of a Python application:\n",
    "- **Optimize the algorithm**: Use more efficient algorithms and data structures. The choice of algorithm significantly affects the performance, especially in data-intensive applications.\n",
    "- **Use built-in functions and libraries**: Pythonâ€™s built-in functions and standard libraries are implemented in C. They are usually faster than custom implementations in Python.\n",
    "- **Use comprehensions**: List comprehensions and generator expressions are generally faster and more memory efficient than equivalent code using `for` loops.\n",
    "- **Use multithreading or multiprocessing**: For I/O-bound tasks, multithreading can help to improve the performance by overlapping I/O and CPU work. For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing can be used to take advantage of multiple CPUs and avoid the GIL.\n",
    "- **Use JIT compilers**: Tools like PyPy (a JIT compiler) can significantly increase the performance of Python code.\n",
    "- **Profiling and tuning**: Use profiling tools like `cProfile` to identify bottlenecks and optimize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of using `cProfile` for profiling a Python script:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cProfile\n",
    "def test_function():\n",
    "    result = [x * 2 for x in range(10000)]\n",

    "### Q10: Explain how closures work in Python and provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A closure in Python is a nested function that remembers values from its enclosing lexical scope even when the program flow is no longer in that scope. Closures allow you to access these captured values, making them useful in situations where you need to generate functions dynamically based on inputs.\n",

    "### Q11: What is duck typing and how is it used in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Duck typing is a concept used in dynamic languages like Python that focuses on the current set of methods and properties an object has rather than ensuring it belongs to a particular class. The name comes from the phrase \"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.\" In Python, this means you can call methods on an object regardless of its class, as long as the methods exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "class Duck:\n",
    "    def quack(self):\n",

    "### Q12: Describe the process and advantages of unit testing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Unit testing involves testing individual components of software to ensure they work as expected. In Python, the `unittest` framework allows you to test small pieces of code in isolation from the rest of the application, which helps in identifying bugs early in the development cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- **Identifies bugs early**: Bugs can be caught before integration, reducing the complexity of later bug fixes.\n",
    "- **Facilitates change**: Unit tests make refactoring safer and encourage developers to modify code since tests can confirm the code still works as intended.\n",
    "- **Simplifies integration**: By ensuring that all individual components work correctly, unit testing reduces problems during integration of these components.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Tests can serve as documentation for new developers, explaining what the code is supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a simple unit test using `unittest`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import unittest\n",

    "### Q23: What is the difference between `break`, `continue`, and `pass` in Python loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- `break` exits the current loop prematurely, stopping the iteration and moving control to the next statement outside of the loop.\n",
    "- `continue` skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves control back to the top of the loop for the next iteration.\n",
    "- `pass` is a null operation â€” nothing happens when it executes. It is syntactically needed to create a block where no action is to be taken (i.e., a loop or a function that does not do anything yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        break  # Stops the loop when i is 5\n",

    "### Q24: What is the difference between `pickle` and `json` modules in Python for serialization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Pickle**: The `pickle` module is Python-specific and can serialize nearly any Python object, including functions and classes. However, it is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data, making it unsuitable for data received from untrusted sources. Its files are not human-readable.\n",
    "- **JSON**: The `json` module serializes objects to a text format that is standard and language-independent. It is suitable for interfacing with web applications and for configurations due to its human-readable format. JSON only supports Python's built-in data types like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans.\n",

    "- `__getattribute__` is called for every attribute regardless of whether it exists or not. This method is powerful for implementing custom behavior on attribute access, but one must be careful to avoid infinite recursion (typically by calling the superclassâ€™s `__getattribute__` method with `super().__getattribute__(attr)`).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
